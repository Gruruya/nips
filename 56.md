Labeling
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is a `kind 1984` note that describes the content of other notes or pubkeys.  
It's a bit similar to a `t` tag, except it can be added by others.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity
labeling the content.

Tags
----

The label event contains one or more tags:
- `[e, <event-id>, <label>]` - Label event
- `[p, <pubkey>]` - Use pubkey to find recommended relays
- `[p, <pubkey>, <label>]` - Same as above, but also label pubkey

The `<label>` may optionally be followed by a classification array,
the array describes what the label means.  
For example, the array may contain:
- `"content"` - The content is about `label`
- `"image"` - The image depicts `label`
- `"nature"` - The event/profile is `label`
- `"+"` - A vote for the `label`
- `"-"` - A `not label`/a vote against the `label`

Without any classification, assume `"+"` and `"content"`

Generally, stick to a single `p` tag so that the recommended relays point
where they should. Even if you're only tagging events, you should include a `p` tag.  

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "e", <event id 1>, "belgium", ["image", "-"]],
    [ "e", <event id 1>, "france", ["image"]],
    [ "e", <event id 2>, "my favorite"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "sfw"]
  ],
  "content": "It's a cute dog!",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event id>, "spam"],
    ["p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "Discusses spam",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event id>, "spam", ["nature"]],
    ["p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "Spam post",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags, they can be used for filtering,
searching, or displayed to draw attention to something.  
Clients may want to consider or display the ratio of positive/negative labels.
You may also want to weigh a label's importance based on how far the labeler is
from someone you're following.  
Labels can be used for sensitive content, for instance, if 3+ of your friends report
a profile's events as explicit, clients can have an option to automatically
blur photos from said account.

Relay behavior
--------------

It is not recommended that relays perform automatic moderation using labels,
as they can be easily gamed. Admins could use labels from trusted moderators to
takedown illegal or explicit content if the relay does not allow such things.

Reporting (DEPRECATED)
----------------------

A report is a special label for moderation.  
A report MUST include a `p` tag referencing the pubkey of the user you
are reporting.

If reporting a note, an `e` tag MUST also be included referencing the note id.

A `report type` string MUST be included as the 3rd entry to the `e` or `p` tag
being reported, which consists of the following report types:

- `nudity` - depictions of nudity, porn, etc.
- `profanity` - profanity, hateful speech, etc.
- `illegal` - something which may be illegal in some jurisdiction
- `spam` - spam
- `impersonation` - someone pretending to be someone else

Some report tags only make sense for profile reports, such as `impersonation`

> Deprecated due to its built-in negativity, emphasizing moderation needs over
  neutral content classification.
