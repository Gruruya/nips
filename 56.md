Labeling
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is a `kind 1984` note that describes other notes or pubkeys.  

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity
labeling the content.

Tags
----

The label event contains one or more tags:
- `[e, <event-id>, <label>]` - Label event
- `[p, <pubkey>, <label>]` - Label pubkey and use pubkey to find recommended relays
- `[p, <pubkey>]` - Use pubkey to find recommended relays

The `<label>` may optionally be followed by a `<context>` such as:
- `"content"` - The content is `label`
- `"image"` - The image depicts `label`
- `"topic"` - The event/profile is about `label`  

Following the context, there may be an `<affirmative marker>` which must be one of the following:
- `"+"` - The `label` matches, a vote for the label.
- `"-"` - The `label` doesn't match, a vote against the label.

If omitted or blank, assume `"content"` and `"+"`.

Generally, stick to a single `p` tag so that the recommended relays point
where they should. Even if you're only labeling events, you should include a `p` tag.  

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "e", <event id 1>, "france", "image"],
    [ "e", <event id 1>, "belgium", "image", "-"],
    [ "e", <event id 2>, "my favorite"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}
```
The above event:
- Labels the first event's image as france
- Votes against labeling the first event's image as belgium
- Labels the second event's content as "my favorite"
- Advises to search relays recommended by `<pubkey>` to find both events.

```JSON
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "nsfw", "", "-"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "sfw"]
  ],
  "content": "It's a cute dog!",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event id>, "spam"],
    ["p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "Spam post",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event id>, "spam", "topic"],
    ["p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "Discusses spam",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags, they can be used for filtering,
searching, or displayed to draw attention to something.

Clients may have a threshold for labels to be considered legitimate,
one example is to weigh a label's legitimacy based on how far the labeler
is from someone you're following.

Clients may, depending on the use case, display the ratio of
positive versus negative labels, or even use this ratio to dynamically adjust
the threshold for legitimacy, creating a form of community-driven moderation.  
Keep in mind that sometimes clients will completely ignore negative labels.

Labels can be used for sensitive content, for instance, if 3+ recent events
from an account are labeled as explicit, clients can have an option
to automatically blur photos from said account.

Relay behavior
--------------

It is not recommended that relays perform automatic moderation using labels,
as they can be easily gamed. Admins could use labels from trusted moderators to
takedown illegal or explicit content if the relay does not allow such things.
