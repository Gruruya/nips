Labeling
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is a `kind 1984` note that describes the content of other notes or pubkeys.  
It's a bit similar to a `t` tag, except it can be added by others.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity
labeling the content.

Tags
----

The label event contains one or more tags:
- `[e, <event-id>, <label>]` - Label event
- `[p, <pubkey>]` - Use pubkey to find recommended relays
- `[p, <pubkey>, <label>]` - Same as above, but also label pubkey

The `<label>` may optionally be followed by a `"+"` or `"-"` to specify if the
label is a vote for or a vote against. Assume positive if omitted.

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "orange", "-"],
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "france"],
    ["e", <event-id-2>, "my favorite"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["p", <pubkey>, "sfw"]
  ],
  "content": "It's a cute dog!",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags, they can be used for filtering,
searching, or displayed to draw attention to something.  
Clients may want to consider or display the ratio of positive/negative labels.
You may also want to weigh a label's importance based on how far the labeler is
from someone you're following.  

Reporting
---------

A report is a special label for moderation.  
A report MUST include a `p` tag referencing the pubkey of the user you
are reporting.

If reporting a note, an `e` tag MUST also be included referencing the note id.

A `report type` string MUST be included as the 3rd entry to the `e` or `p` tag
being reported, which consists of the following report types:

- `nudity` - depictions of nudity, porn, etc.
- `profanity` - profanity, hateful speech, etc.
- `illegal` - something which may be illegal in some jurisdiction
- `spam` - spam
- `impersonation` - someone pretending to be someone else

Some report tags only make sense for profile reports, such as `impersonation`

"+" and "-" are not applicable to reports.

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "nudity"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "e", <eventId>, "illegal"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "He's insulting the king!",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <impersonator pubkey>, "impersonation"],
    [ "p", <victim pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "Profile is imitating #[1]",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Clients can use reports from friends to make moderation decisions if they
choose to. For instance, if 3+ of your friends report a profile as explicit,
clients can have an option to automatically blur photos from said account.


Relay behavior
--------------

It is not recommended that relays perform automatic moderation using reports,
as they can be easily gamed. Admins could use reports from trusted moderators to
takedown illegal or explicit content if the relay does not allow such things.
