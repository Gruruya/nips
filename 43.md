Labels
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is an event of kind `1983`, it describes the content of an event.  
It's a bit similar to a `t` tag, except it can be added by others.  

Labels can be assigned to both events and profiles.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity labeling the content.

Tags
----

The event contains one or more tags:
- `[e, <event-id>, <label>]` - Label event
- `[p, <pubkey>]` - Use pubkey for recommended relays
- `[p, <pubkey>, <label>]` - Same as above, but also label pubkey

The `<label>` may optionally be followed by a `"+"` or `"-"` to specify if the label is a vote for or a vote against. Assume positive if omitted.

Client behavior
---------------

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags, they can be used for filtering, searching, or displayed to draw attention to something.  
Clients may want to consider or display the ratio of positive/negative labels. You may also want to weigh a label's importance based on how far the labeler is from someone you're following.
