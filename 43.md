Labels
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is an event of kind `1983`, it describes the content of an event.  
It is similar to a `t` tag, but it can be added by others.  

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags. For instance, they can be used for filtering or searching or displayed to draw attention to something.  
Labels can be assigned to events and profiles.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity labelling the content.

Tags
----

The event contains one or more tags consisting of `e` or `p` followed by a label.  
The tags may optionally be followed by a `"+"` or `"-"` to specify if the label is a vote for or a vote against. Assume positive if omitted.

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 1983,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "orange", "-"],
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "france"],
    ["e", <event-id-2>, "my favorite"],
  ],
  "content": "",

  "kind": 1983,
  "tags": [

}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Clients may use labels to filter events.  
Clients may display labels next to profiles and events.  
When doing this, clients may consider what to show based on the ratio of positive/negative labels. A client doing this may also want to weigh a label based on how far the labeller is from someone you're following.
