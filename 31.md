Labels
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:gruruya`

A label is an event of kind `111`, it describes the content of an event, according to an entity.  
It is similar to a `t` tag, but it can be added by others.  

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags. For instance, they can be used for filtering or searching or displayed to draw attention to something.
Labels can be assigned to events and profiles.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity labelling the content.

Tags
----

The `111` label event may include one or more `e` tags followed by a label and must include a single `p` tag, optionally followed by a label.  

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 111,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "nudity"],
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "spam"],
    ["e", <event-id-2>, "my favorite"],
    ["p", <pubkey>]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 111,
  "tags": [
    ["p", <pubkey>, "sfw"]
  ],
  "content": "It's a cute dog!",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Clients may use labels to filter events.  
Clients may display profiles' and events' labels to users.  
When doing this, clients should decide what labels to show, one option is to weigh labels based on if the labeller is someone you're following. Clients may also display who applied what labels or the number of labels applied.  
Nudity labels and nudity reports as described in NIP-56 should be considered together.  

Relay behavior
--------------

Consider nudity labels the same as nudity reports.
