Labels
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:michaelhall923` `author:gruruya`

A label is an event of kind `111`, it describes the content of an event, according to an entity.  
It is similar to a `t` tag, but it can be added by others.  

Labels can be used the same way as hashtags. For instance, they can be used for filtering or searching or displayed to draw attention to something.
Labels can be assigned to events and profiles.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity labelling the content.

Tags
----

The `111` label event consists of the following tags:
- exactly one `p` tag, optionally followed by a label
- optionally one or more `e` tags followed by a label
If a label is specified, there may be another element following it containing either a `"+"` or `"-"` to specify if the label is a vote for or a vote against. Assume positive if omitted.

{
  "kind": 111,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "orange", "-"],

Client behavior
---------------

Clients may use labels to filter events.  
Clients may display profiles' and events' labels.  
When doing this, clients should decide what labels to show, one option is to weigh labels based on how far the labeller is from someone you're following.
