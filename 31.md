Labels
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:gruruya`

A label is an event of kind `111` or `31111`, it describes the content of an event, according to an entity.  
It is similar to a `t` tag, but it can be added by others.  

Labels allow for a user-defined level of moderation of arbitrary precision, among other things.  
A label such as "nudity" may be filtered to keep nudity content away and a label such as "nostr" could be used to search for a specific topic.

The content of a label event MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity labelling the content.

Tags
----

The `111` label event must include at least one `e` or `p` tag referencing an event id or pubkey to label followed by a label.  
The `31111` label event has the same structure, but it should only reference a single event/pubkey and have that hash as its `d` parameter.

A few standardized labels and their meanings follow:
- `sfw` - Safe, the content is completely non-sexual
- `questionable` - Potentially sexual content, soft-core porn
- `nudity` - Exposed genitalia or woman's chest

Example events
--------------

```json
{
  "kind": 111,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "nudity"],
    ["e", <event-id-1>, "spam"],
    ["e", <event-id-2>, "my favorite"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}

{
  "kind": 31111,
  "tags": [
    ["d", <pubkey>],
    ["p", <pubkey>, "sfw"]
  ],
  "content": "It's a cute dog!",
  ...
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Clients may use labels to filter events.  
For nudity, labels, hashtags, and nudity reports as described in NIP-56 should be considered together.  
Clients should decide how to weigh labels against each other, one option is to weigh labels based on if the labeller is someone you're following or indirectly following.  

Relay behavior
--------------

Consider nudity labels the same as nudity reports.
